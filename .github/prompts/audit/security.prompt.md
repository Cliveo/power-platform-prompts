# Security audit

I need help finding changes to this #codebase that do not align with the following standards for security.

Security vulnerabilities can be sensitive, do not attempt to refactor the code, only highlight to the user that they have been found.

I need you to check web resources for any code containing, vulnerabilities or passwords/secrets.
